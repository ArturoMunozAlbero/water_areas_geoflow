# water_areas_geoflow
Geoflow for publishing GRSF water areas in the GRSF SDI (OGC metadata and data services)

The water_areas_geoflow connects the water_areas_vocabulary (https://github.com/GRSF/water_areas_vocabulary) with the water_areas_shapefiles (https://github.com/GRSF/water_areas_shapefiles) for publishing the GRSF water areas in an standardized format following the water_areas_vocabulary fields.
